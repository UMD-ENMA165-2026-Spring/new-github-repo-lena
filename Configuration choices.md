# Explanations to my choices!
- I chose to make my repository public as I personally have nothing to hide. Also, it is easier for grading to have open access.
- I chose the MIT license since it allows broad reuse and modifcation with minimal restrictions while also keeping author attribution.
- My README file has been renamed into the main assignment under Japanese_Literature. I don't believe a "longer" description is necessary for this assignment as the assignment details are available on ELMS.
- I added this file so I could explain my choices. This is self-explanatory.
- I created and delete a file called trash.md to fulfill the rubric.

## The three commit explanations
  - My first commit was to rename the README file and list out my books.
  - My second commit was to organize the books by their authors.
  - My third commit was to add personal ratings to the books I've read.
